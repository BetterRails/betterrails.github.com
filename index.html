<h1>Better Rails</h1>

<p>
  Working towards a better rails world for all...
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
  Better Rails is in the process of becoming a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization that exists to help better the Ruby on Rails ecosystem. It's 2 short term objectives are:
  <ol>
    <li>Provide an open source, free hosted service for monitoring and measuring the performance of individual Rails applications</li>
    <li>Provide an open source, free hosted service for error reporting of individual Rails applications</li>
  </ol>
  
  These are still in the very early concept stages, but the vision is there.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
  Better Rails is being headed up by Mark McSpadden. (That's me.) I am very grateful for all that people have contributed to Rails, and all that Rails has done for me, but there are a few corners of the ecosystem where I think we can do better. This organization is setup to help with that vision.
